Library Application (Java Programming Language)

Implementation of search / sort methods on a particular data set  

The program must allow a user to view books sorted in ascending order according to the following choices (ie books must be sorted according to each named field)
1.	By title  
2.	By genre  
3.	By year  
4.	By isbn  

User must also be able to view all books by the same author, ordered according to the same choices:

1.	By title  
2.	By genre  
3.	By year  
4.	By isbn  

I used Java and NeatBeans IDE to implement this tool
