Library Application (Java Programming Language)

Implementation of search / sort methods on a particular data set  

The program must allow a user to view books sorted in ascending order according to the following choices (ie books must be sorted according to each named field)
1.	By title  
2.	By genre  
3.	By year  
4.	By isbn  

User must also be able to view all books by the same author, ordered according to the same choices:

1.	By title  
2.	By genre  
3.	By year  
4.	By isbn  

I used Java and NeatBeans IDE to implement this tool.
The most important concept implemented on this application is the comparator interface. A comparator interface is used to order the objects of user-defined classes. A comparator object is capable of comparing two objects of the same class.
